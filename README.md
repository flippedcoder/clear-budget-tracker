# simple-budget-tracker

This app lets you record what you bought, when you bought it, and how much it cost. It lets you group expenses by category and gives you a percentage breakdown of each category.

## Motivation

The main reason I made it is because I got tired of apps having access to all of my sensitive bank info when I just wanted to keep a manual track of what I was buying.

## Set up

1. Clone the repo
2. cd into the "client" directory and run `npm install`
3. cd into the "server" directory and run `npm install`
4. Open two terminals, one for the "client" and one for the "server"
5. Run `npm start` in both terminals

This is just here in case anybody wanted to know how I find color schemes, for better or worse.
